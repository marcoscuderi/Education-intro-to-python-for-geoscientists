# Education-intro-to-python-for-geoscientists  
This is a collection of scripts that I use to teach, at the undergraduate level, an introduction to Python programming.   
This scripts are followed by problem solving exercises.

The scrips are thought to give a general idea of the basic tools that python offers for a geoscientist.  
The Notebook can be nicely integrated with the study of the book:  
- Effective computation in physics by A. Scopaz and K, Huff published by O'Relly
- Python for data nalysis by W. McKinney published by O'Relly
- Introduction to python in Earth science data analysis by M. Petrelli published by Springer
